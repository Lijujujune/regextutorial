# Title Understanding Regex for Matching an Email Address Example

IIn web development, regex (regular expressions) are crucial tools for validating user input, including email addresses. Whether you are working on a form that requires email input or creating authentication systems, validating email addresses correctly is important. In this tutorial, we will break down a regex pattern used for matching email addresses. By analyzing each component step-by-step, you’ll gain a solid understanding of how this pattern works.


## Summary

This tutorial will be explaining the following regex, which is designed to validate a standard email address:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

	•	^: Ensures that the pattern matches from the start of the string.
	•	$: Ensures that the pattern matches till the end of the string.
In this regex, ^ and $ ensure that the input must be a complete email address with no extra characters.

#### Code Snippet:
	•	^ ... $
 Using user123@gmail.com as example in this tutorial, the anchors ensure that the entire string is evaluated, matching the email format from beginning to end.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should appear.

	•	+: In this regex, the + quantifier means “one or more occurrences” of the preceding character or group.

#### Code Snippet:
	•	[a-z0-9_\.-]+
In this example user123 would match the regex pattern since user123 contains one or mor valid characters from this defined characters set.

### Grouping Constructs

Parentheses () are used to group parts of the regex.

	•	([a-z0-9_\.-]+): The first group matches the username portion of the email.
 	•	@: the one and only @ symbol between username and domain name of an email adress.
	•	([\da-z\.-]+): The second group matches the domain name (e.g., gmail,hotmail).
	•	([a-z\.]{2,6}): The third group matches the top-level domain (e.g., .com or .co.uk).

 #### Code Snippet:
	•	([a-z0-9_\.-]+) @ ([\da-z\.-]+) \. ([a-z\.]{2,6})
 In the email user123@gmail.com, user name: user123 is captured by the first group, gmail by the second group, and com by the third group.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions (character sets) define a range of characters that can match.

	•	[a-z0-9_\.-]: Matches any lowercase letter a-z, any digit 0-9, an underscore _, a dot ., or a hyphen - in the username.
	•	[\da-z\.-]: Matches any digit \d, any lowercase letter a-z, a dot ., or a hyphen - in the domain name.
	•	[a-z\.]: Matches any lowercase letter a-z or a dot . in the top-level domain (e.g., .com).

#### Code Snippet:
	•	[a-z0-9_\.-]
The string user123, user-123 or user.name123 are all valid because it consists of characters defined in the character set.
 
### Character Classes

Character classes define specific types of characters that can be matched:

	•	\d: d stand for digits, which matches any digit between 0-9.
 	•	a-z: stand for any lower letters a-z
  	•	\.-: stand for literal a dot or a hyphen
#### Code Snippet:
	•	[\da-z\.-]
In this example, user123@gmail.com. user matched the a-z class, 123 matched \d.

### Character Escapes

Certain characters have special meanings than its literal meanings, if you want to match these characters literally rather than special functions, you will need to escape them by a blackslahs (\)

#### Code Snippet:
	•	\.: Escapes the dot . character
Like mentioned above, in regex, . typically matches any character. By escaping it, that ensure that it matches a literal dot as used in email addresses (e.g., gmail.com).
