# Title Understanding Regex for Matching an Email Address Example

IIn web development, regex (regular expressions) are crucial tools for validating user input, including email addresses. Whether you are working on a form that requires email input or creating authentication systems, validating email addresses correctly is important. In this tutorial, we will break down a regex pattern used for matching email addresses. By analyzing each component step-by-step, you’ll gain a solid understanding of how this pattern works.


## Summary

This tutorial will be explaining the following regex, which is designed to validate a standard email address:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

	•	^: Ensures that the pattern matches from the start of the string.
	•	$: Ensures that the pattern matches till the end of the string.

In this regex, ^ and $ ensure that the input must be a complete email address with no extra characters.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should appear.

	•	+: In this regex, the + quantifier means “one or more occurrences” of the preceding character or group.

For example:

	•	[a-z0-9_\.-]+: This part allows one or more of the specified characters to appear in the username section of the email.

### Grouping Constructs

Parentheses () are used to group parts of the regex.

	•	([a-z0-9_\.-]+): The first group matches the username portion of the email.
    •	@: the one and only @ symbol between username and domain name of an email adress.
	•	([\da-z\.-]+): The second group matches the domain name (e.g., gmail,hotmail).
	•	([a-z\.]{2,6}): The third group matches the top-level domain (e.g., .com or .co.uk).
